          <p>
            I’m <strong>Maryan Ahmed</strong>, a front-end developer passionate
            about crafting responsive, user-friendly digital experiences with
            React, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

            <h2>My Journey</h2>
            <p>
              Two years ago, I dove into coding without much experience — just
              curiosity and determination. Over time, I’ve transformed that
              uncertainty into a meaningful skill. Today, I’m proud to build
              modern, responsive web apps that bring real value to users.

            <h2>My Mission</h2>
            <p>
              My mission is to build apps that are not only helpful, but also
              elegant, accessible, and intuitive. I believe that with the power
              of React and a strong learning mindset, I can create tools that
              solve real-world problems — beyond just websites.
